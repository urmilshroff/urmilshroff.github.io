# About Me

This is a simple and clean webpage about me, Urmil Shroff. It showcases some of my work as a developer, tells people a little something about who I am and also provides links to my social media footprint. If you're hiring, you can check out my Résumé [here](https://github.com/urmilshroff/urmilshroff.github.io/raw/master/R%C3%A9sum%C3%A9%20-%20Urmil%20Shroff.pdf).
